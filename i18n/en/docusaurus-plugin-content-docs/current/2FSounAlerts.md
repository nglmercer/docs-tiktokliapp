## Configure sound alerts for each gift
### Link Gifts to a Sound
use the images and names from [image-page](/my-react-page)
Rename the sounds to correspond to the gifts. For example:
- Rose.mp3 
- Tiktok.mp3 
- Cap Champion.mp3
#### TIPS
- use several names to reuse the same sound
- remove any element if necessary it will not break the app in any way
- test the audio to unlock the audio by pressing **SKIP**.
